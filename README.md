# Drum-s-kit
The Drum Kit Project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to play drum sounds using either mouse clicks or keyboard presses. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a beginner-friendly yet engaging exercise for those learning web development and DOM manipulation.
